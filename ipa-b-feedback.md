# IPA-B Feedback for WONG WEI HAO
                                        
**OVERALL IPA-A + IPA-B Grade**: B-

**IPA-B Grade**: A
                                        
## B1
complete 3D scene (with (a) a background environment or live video feed and (b) manipulable objects) and clear consistent theme
                                        
## B2
both desktop and an additional form of grab and translate interaction exist and works well
                                        
## B3
desktop-based attach interaction exists and works well
                                        
## B4
desktop-based rotate interaction exists and works well
                                        
## B5
desktop-based "pinch" interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## B6
both desktop and an additional form of locomotion interaction exist and works well
                                        
## Other feedback
Good job in improving the README.
The interactions in VR work but some were designed based on the same desktop-based modalities. The cardboard-based controls should be much simpler.
The HMD rotation was also rather buggy.
