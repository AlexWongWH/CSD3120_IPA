# CSD3120-IPA
Author: Wong Wei Hao 2002316
Project: CSD3120_IPA
IPA assignment for CSD3120

##About the project
This innovative project harnesses the power of Babylon.js, a cutting-edge 3D graphics engine, and Webpack, a powerful build tool, to create an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience designed to transport student into a classroom environment. This VR experience has been optimized for the Google Cardboard platform, ensuring maximum compatibility and accessibility. 
The goal of this experience is to provide a unique and engaging way for users to learn the fundamental principles of chemistry, specifically the concept of balancing chemical equations.

## Architecture
Root
|-`assets` folder contains models, videos, editing data and recording data for the purpose for this assignment.
|
|-`dist` folder contains html and js files that are automatically generated by the webpack command and assets used by the VR scene
|
|`src` folder contains manually-written code that handles the implementation for this project.
| |
| |-`components` folder cotains files used for the vr scene
| |		|-`env` folder contains .ts files which are code used to construct the VR environment
| | 	|
| | 	|-`meshes` folder contains .ts files which are code used to meshes/basic shapes
| |
| |-`app.ts` Contains the app class where all main logic is held
| |
| |-`index.html` The html canvas template which is used to open is the web browser
| |
| |-`index.ts` Basically "main.cpp", entry point of the VR development code
| |
| |-`index-ext.ts` .ts file declaration which is used to create the extension to the xrauthor docker
| |
| |-`init.ts` contains the init function which is used
|		
|-`.gitignore` is for ignoring certain files when committing to source control. The `node_modules` folder is ignored
|
|-`package.json` is the JSON file listing the details of this project and its dependencies along with scripts that could be run through npm.
|
|-`package-lock.json` is the automatically-generated JSON file that contains more information and should not be directly edited.
|
|-`README.md` the file which is to be read to know more about the project
|
|-`tsconfig.json` is the configuration file for transpiling from written TS code into JS code.
|
|-`webpack.config.js` configuration file for the webpack.

## Setup for dependecies and starting up
Make sure to do these commands **in order** on your powershell CLI in the root directory of this project folder:

Install npm by `npm install -g npm`

Install babylonjs by `npm install --save babylonjs`

Install webpack dependecies by `npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin`

Install typescript dependecies by `npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader`

Install babylonjs GUI by `npm install --save babylonjs-gui`

Install xrauthor-loader by `npm i xrauthor-loader -D`

Inside the package.json file, add this code snippet into the "scripts` section:

   "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack",
    "build-ext": "webpack --config webpack.ext.js",
    "serve": "webpack serve",
    "start": "webpack serve --open"
  },

Type `npm run build` to build the server

Type `npm run serve` to start running the server that hosts the web app, which could be accessed through the URL `localhost:9000` (ensure that port 9000 is not currently in use)

Type `npm run build-ext` generate and index.ts to upload to xrauthor 

Press Ctrl+C twice to stop the server once you are done using it.
